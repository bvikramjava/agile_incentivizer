==================

Angular and Firebase Angile Incentivizer Early Prototype

Intent
------

This application is a proof of concept/prototype of an idea. The idea is to take the "task weight" concept out of the
agile methodology and make apply it to everyday or petty management.  The setups would be for parent/child relationships,
or any other relationship where a party can reward another for completing work. A task list is created, tasks get an
agreed upon weight, and upon completing a certain amount of weight, they worker can "cash in" on those weight to get certain
rewards. This aligns the incentives of the worker and the intentions of the manager in a way that prioritizes tasks and
allows the worker to work at their own pace. It also introduces a little bit of game theory, and allows workers to compete
for points, creating the competition that benefits the manager. It also prevents slackers from prospering in a workplace.

Implementation
--------------
As previously stated, this is a proof of concept demo. This uses angular and firebase to create a application that was
quick to setup and test because there is no need for a backend setup.
